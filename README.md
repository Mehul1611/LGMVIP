# Let's Grow More Internship
## Overview
During my internship at Let's Grow More, I engaged in diverse machine learning projects,covering areas like facial recognition, decision trees, global terrorism analysis, and more. 
The hands-on experience enhanced my Python skills and allowed me to apply machine learning techniques to real-world challenges. This repository showcases the outcomes of my efforts, 
reflecting my growth in neural networks, data analysis, and prediction modeling. Grateful for the opportunity, I'm eager to continue evolving in the dynamic field of machine learning.
